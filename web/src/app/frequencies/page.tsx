    title: "Tower Operations",
    description:
      "Tower controllers manage aircraft in the immediate vicinity of the airportâ€”typically the runway and traffic pattern. They issue takeoff and landing clearances, sequencing departures and arrivals to maintain safe separation.",
  },
  {
    title: "Ground Control",
    description:
      "Ground handles aircraft and vehicles on taxiways and ramps. Controllers provide taxi clearances, monitor surface movement, and ensure conflicts are avoided before aircraft reach the runway.",
  },
  {
    title: "Approach & Departure",
    description:
      "Approach and departure controllers transition aircraft between en-route airspace and the terminal area. They coordinate climbs, descents, and vectors to efficiently sequence flights around congested airspace.",
  },
  {
    title: "Center / En-Route",

      "Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs) oversee aircraft cruising between airports. They manage large sectors of airspace, coordinating altitude changes and hand-offs between adjacent sectors and facilities.",

  {
    call: "ATIS",
    meaning:
      "Automatic Terminal Information Service broadcasts current weather, runways in use, and airport notices. Pilots state the letter code (e.g., 'Information Bravo') to confirm receipt when contacting controllers.",
  },
  {
    call: "Clearance Delivery",
    meaning:
      "Provides instrument flight rules (IFR) route clearance before taxi. Typical read-back includes the cleared route, initial altitude, departure frequency, and transponder code.",
  },
  {
    call: "Taxi / Ground",
    meaning:
      "Ground control gives taxi instructions such as 'Taxi to Runway 27 via Alpha, hold short Runway 22'. Pilots must read back hold short instructions and runway assignments to confirm compliance.",
  },
  {
    call: "Takeoff Clearance",
    meaning:
      "When tower issues 'Cleared for takeoff', the aircraft may enter the runway and depart. Pilots read back the clearance to acknowledge and begin the roll when safe.",
  },
  {
    call: "Landing Clearance",
    meaning:
      "Tower communicates 'Cleared to land' once the runway is verified clear. Pilots acknowledge and continue final approach, reporting if unable or executing a go-around as necessary.",
  },
  {
    call: "Handoff / Frequency Change",
    meaning:
      "Controllers coordinate handoffs between facilities. A call like 'Contact Departure on 118.5' prompts pilots to switch frequencies, check in, and continue on the new controller's instructions.",
