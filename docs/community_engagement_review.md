# Community Engagement Review

## Current Strengths
- Rich aviation data model covering airports, spotting locations, and community posts provides a solid base for storytelling.
- Existing badge system gives you a foundation for gamified nudges.
- REST API already exposes most domain entities, simplifying client integrations.

## Opportunities for Improvement
1. **Surface Momentum Quickly**
   - Provide a lightweight engagement summary endpoint that front-ends can call to show trending topics, active challenges, and recent badge earners on dashboards.
   - Highlight activity in the first screen after login to encourage return visits.
2. **Guided Challenges**
   - Track completion state automatically when users update challenge progress so admins do not have to audit it manually.
   - Include progress percentages in the API response so clients can show friendly progress bars.
3. **Contextual Feed Items**
   - Mix challenge completions alongside posts and badge unlocks so users see more ways to participate.
   - Offer quick actions (e.g., join challenge, reply to trending topic) directly from the feed cards.

## Next Steps
- Add server-side guardrails to keep challenge status accurate even if clients do not set the `completed` flag explicitly.
- Build UI widgets that consume the new engagement summary API and experiment with different layouts (hero banner vs. sidebar module).
- Continue investing in analytics (e.g., streak tracking, heatmaps of airport activity) to personalize nudges for each spotter.

These adjustments should help the community discover new conversations faster, celebrate progress automatically, and maintain reliable challenge data as participation scales.
